        <li>4 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 ounces cubed processed cheese food</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces milk</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Place a saucepan over medium-low heat. Combine the cheese food, milk, and pepper in the saucepan; cook until the cheese has melted, stirring frequently. Stir in the drained macaroni until evenly coated.</li>
